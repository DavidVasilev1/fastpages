            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. Fun fact CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. . SCSS vs. CSS . Understanding the differences between SCSS and CSS . What is CSS . CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user. . | However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course. . | . CSS Example . This is an example of CSS that can be used to change body text of an HTML document | Hack Question:Can you guess what its changing style of the text to? - It is changing the font color to blue, the font type, and the font size to 16 pixels. | . &lt;style&gt; body{ color: #0000FF; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } &lt;/style&gt; . What is SCSS . SCSS is short for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. | SCSS very similar to CSS but the difference comes with the fact that SCSS extends the functionality of CSS while also making it simpler. What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. | . Sass Code Example . $blue: #0000FF; body{ color: $blue; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . This example is doing the same thing as the other code segment above but the difference being that here we defined the color as $blue which makes it much easier for us to recall later on. In fact, we have done this before, if you have been using the dark mode/midnight theme then go ahead and navigate your your _sass folder and check out the dark-mode.scss and you&#39;ll see something similar to the example above | . So which one is better to use? . CSS tends to be better for really simple styling where not many complex or nested styles are required and small projects that doesn&#39;t require a lot of customization. | SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. Such as the projects we made last and first trimester. | . Modular SCSS . Understanding how to use modular SCSS . Modular SCSS allows you to break multiple different files and then be able to compile them into a single CSS file | How do you do this? Well all you need to do is have _filenames.scss so that is compiled into its own file | Now after adding the to the file name you can import it into you file without the and all the styles will be carried over. | The benefits of a partial is that it allows you to big websites and allows you to break up the code in multiple components and easily make changes instead of having to go through a huge file. | All styles in the partial will be added and can be used into the main file as if they were defined in the main file. | . File 1 _variable.scss . $primary-button-color: #009494; $hover-color: black; $menu-color: #f2f2f2; . File 2 style.scss . We can see the importing of the .scss file&#39;s content into the other main .scss file style.scss | . {@import &#39;variables&#39;; @import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;} /* &quot;row style&quot; is flexible size and aligns pictures in center */ .row { align-items: center; display: flex; } /* &quot;column style&quot; is one-third of the width with padding */ .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } .menu a { // float: left; display: block; color: $menu-color; text-align: center; // padding: 14px 16px; text-decoration: none; } .menu a:hover { background: $primary-button-color; color: $hover-color; } . Nesting . What is nesting? Where did the birds come from? . Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). | Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read. | When we make HTML we often nest different elements within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it. | The problem is that in regular CSS we don&#39;t have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code. | . Warning:Don&#39;t nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name. ## Sass Nesting | Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall. | . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . CSS - Lack of Nesting . We can see that through the lack of nesting the CSS is not as organized and needs extra information to be able to make it more clear exactly what is being targeted. | . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . Variables . What is a variable? . A variable is a container that stores information so for instance when you multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value. | This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that value in multiple places throughout you stylesheet. | Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. | . Pro Tip:The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are more consider and easier to read with a much simpler syntax. Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. . Variable Example Syntax . $variable-name: value; | Once the sass is processed the variable name is replaced with the value throughout the program. | . $main-font: Calibri, sans-serif; $main-color: #000; $main-color-hover: #000; . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . // Html &lt;p id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;original text and&lt;/p&gt; // SASS #testing:after{ content: &quot; some&quot; + &quot; more&quot; + &quot; text&quot;; } // Output original text and some more text . Conditional Statements . There are conditional statements in SASS just like in Python and JavaScript they work the same way as well. | Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Such as if a certain condition is true then do this, if it is false then do that and so on. | SASS has @if which allows for different styles based on if a boolean expression was true or false. | SASS has @else which allows for different set of styles if the if condition was not met or false. | SASS has @else if which allows for an alternative conditions to be run if the first is not met. | . $color: red; button { @if $color == red { background-color: $color; } } // @else: allows you to provide an alternative set of styles to apply if the condition in the @if statement isn&#39;t met $color: blue; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else { background-color: $color; } } // @else if: allows you to provide multiple alternative conditions to test $color: green; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else if $color == blue { background-color: blue; } @else { background-color: $color; } } . Loops In Sass . Loops are present in SASS through the @for and @while decorators, along with @each. | Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met just like in any other programming language. . For Loops: Are used to iterate through a value like a list or a range of numbers | While Loops: Are used to iterate through a block of code until a certain condition is met such as a value is being equal to a certain value through an incrementing or decrementing a variable or any other condition that is met. | . | When using while loops they can be necessary but it is better to use @each and @for as it will make it clear and be able to compile faster. . | Side Note: In SASS lists care a any group of values that are separated by a comma or a space there is no special brackets used like in python or javascript. Lists can be searched for values however they are immutable meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. . | . Some Code Examples of Loops and Lists . // A for each loop is used to interact with a group of sizes changing // the size of the element for each item in the list $sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px; @each $size in $sizes { .icon-#{$size} { font-size: $size; height: $size; width: $size; } } // @each: allows you to loop over a list of values and generate styles $colors: red, green, blue; @each $color in $colors { .color-#{$color} { background-color: $color; } } . @debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1 @debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2 @debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null . @use &quot;sass:math&quot;; /// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it&#39;s below `$base`. @function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) { @while $value &gt; $base { $value: math.div($value, $ratio); } @return $value; } $normal-font-size: 16px; sup { font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px); } . $base-color: #036; @for $i from 1 through 3 { ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) { background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%); } } // @for: allows you to loop over a range of values and generate styles @for $i from 1 through 3 { .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; } } . Functions in SASS . What is a function? . A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. This is a great method to be able to reuse code and processes in a manner that is more efficient and allows for the reuse of code. We do this all the time in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. | . SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet and allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, plus you can generate content dynamically. . | There a are built in functions and ones you can make on your own like languages such as JavaScript and Python. . | SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . | Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . | . Using Built-in Functions . Like Python and Javascript SASS provides a variety of built-in functions for math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. | . Math Functions . SASS has many functions that allow you to be able to perform wide range of math operations similar to the ones present in python including more complex operations. | . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . Color is an important component of any website and SASS provides a wide range of functions that allow you to manipulate colors in a variety of ways. | . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: | . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function name(arguments){} | @return is similar to the return statement in JavaScript and Python. It returns a value from a function. | Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: | . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Or you can also make a different kind of function that increases the font size to the factorial of a inputted number. | . @function factorial($number){ $calculated: 1; @for $_ from 1 through $number { $calculated: $calculated*$number; } @return $calculated; } #testing { font-size: factorial(3); } . //Combining functions and loops to achieve different sass effects @function sum($numList){ $sum: 0; @each $num in $numList { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $num; } @function tri($num){ $sum: 0; @for $i from 1 through $num { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $sum; } @function max($nums){ $i:0; $value:0px; @while $i&lt;length($nums){ @if $value&lt;list.nth($nums,$i){ $value:list.nth($nums,$i); } } } . Custom functions are very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . | SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. . | . Mixins . Mixin what is a mix in what are we mixing in? . Mixins are a way to make groups of CSS that you want to reuse throughout your site anywhere you please. | Mixins are a form of template and that you can use to build on top of to make different features later on this prevents you from having to write the same code over and over again. | This is a form of encapsulation in your CSS and is a great way to make your code more organized and easier to read. | Mixins can also take in arguments and be able to be used to apply effects on certain elements if that is a feature you want to add to your site. However unlike functions which also take arguments mixins cannot return values. | To use a mixin declare it with @mixin and then incorporate with @include. | . Inheritance . What is inheritance? . In general programming concept where the child class can inherit properties from the parent class. These properties can be changed and modified in the child class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible. | In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. | We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that | . Mixin &amp; Inheritance Code Example . // example of @mixin @mixin button { width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #21807c; border: 3px solid black; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 1; // creates smooth animation effect transition: all 0.5s; } // default button theme for calculator and stopwatch buttons. Both will follow the same button format .button { // uses the scss from the @mixin @include button; } /* styling for the calculator clear button */ .calculator-button-clear { // @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e68b1c; } /* styling for the calculator equals button */ .calculator-button-equals { // another @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e70f0f; } . Hacks &amp; Hack Helper - Calculator &amp; Hack Helper - Stopwatch . All hacks are pair/trio hacks, individual hacks are not recommended and will not be accepted unless a valid reason is given. We will respond in the appropriate slack channel if we have any questions. Hacks are due by 11:59pm on Wednesday 4/26/2023 at 11:59 p.m. PST. Any late submission will have a deduction of 0.1 points from their total grade. | . Part 1: Reflections 0.4 Points . Write a short description of each key feature of Sass and compare it to how it to CSS and how using Sass makes your life easier when using all the features. Include examples of how it would have made prior features from past projects simpler to implement. Also answer the questions indicated as hack questions. | . Part 2: Sass Demo 0.5+ Points . Using at least 3 or more sass features create a UI demo that may be used for future or current projects and reflect on how this was more effective than doing the same task using only regular features of CSS. Extra points will be awarded based on creativity and extra addition of features from SASS. | . Credits: Team Mortalicously Sassy 💖 . Feature SASS CSS . Modular Design | Allows to split features between multiple files, leading to better organization of the workflow of a project. This allows for easy importing and exporting between code, which is much more difficult in CSS, where there needs to be an import of every single file or variable separately. | In CSS, you can import individual files and variables with @import, however this takes up more time and code than SASS, making it more inefficient. | . Nesting | This allows for many tags and elements to be organized under certain names and groups, allowing for more organized code. This prevents repetitive code, eliminating useless code. It also allows code to be read better, leading to more | Can assign different stylings to different groups and names, but, must repeat the group name for each individual tag and element. | . Variabes | Easier syntax to use when defining variables. Defined in bash-style &quot;$&quot; format.&lt;/td&gt; More convoluded syntax, using the var() function to declare any variables and values. | &lt;/tr&gt; Operators | SASS operators are similar to those of Python. They allow for operations to be performed, allowing for more diversity in what can be done with styling in SASS. Instead of using Javascript to change styling, it can directly be done in SASS. | CSS doesn&#39;t use operators, meaning that it needs to be manipulated with Javascript if needed. This becomes more difficult and inefficient because variables need to be be created twice and imported and exported multiple times in one program to translate between languages. | . Conditionals | SASS can use conditionals in order to perform actions based on certain conditions. This can all be done within SASS rather than in CSS, where there is a need to export and import between languages in order to change the properties of a style | CSS can not use conditionals, as it needs to rely on Javascript to complete any actions. This is something that adds complexity to the project, which is completely unnecessary as it should all be done locally like in SASS rather than in CSS and Javascript. | . Loops | Loops allow to change a large amount of data with a list that is pre-defined. This can save time when one is writing code that changes a large amount of data with certain conditions being met. Variables can be changed with certain conditions and then applied from a list quickly through the use of loops. | CSS doesn&#39;t use loops and therefore doesn&#39;t have the same functionality as SASS. Variables can only be set once and cannot be changed in the future. It is only possible to change them with the use of Javascript, which add unnecessary steps in code. | . Functions | SASS allows for declaration of functions taking variable arguments. Defined using the @function keyword. Allows for dynamically generating content on a webpage. There are also default functions like math, color, and string. | CSS does not have dynamically defined functions, however there are builtin CSS functions such as calc() and attr() | . Mixin | Blocks of reusable CSS that could be used anywhere, anyplace. Allows for the creation of blueprints and templates for additional CSS refinement. Can be declared with @mixin and be called with @include. | Does not exist in CSS. | . Inheritance | Can create a main class or assortment of CSS options, and then have a child class inherit the default options and then make appropriate additions or changes. Called with @extend | Also exists within regular CSS, properties are passed down from parent elements to child elements. | . &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 2nd Hack . https://github.com/dolphinalt/scss_Hacks .

Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the constraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . .

Here we initialize the total population to be 50, then set the growth factor as 1.00005 (.005 percent change). It will print the population every 56th day until it reaches one million. It multiplies the current population by the growth factor in each iteration, and increments the day count. When the day count reaches 56, it prints the current population and resets the day count to 0. . Note! This simulation assumes that the growth factor remains constant as time progresses, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world scenarios. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define the initial population and growth rate population = 100 growth_rate = 0.05 # Define the number of years to simulate num_years = 50 # Create lists to store the population and year values populations = [population] years = [0] # Simulate population growth for the specified number of years for year in range(1, num_years+1): # Calculate the new population size new_population = population + (growth_rate * population) # Update the population and year lists populations.append(new_population) years.append(year) # Set the new population as the current population for the next iteration population = new_population # Plot the population growth over time plt.plot(years, populations) plt.xlabel(&#39;Year&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Population&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Population Growth Simulation&#39;) plt.show() .

Learning Objectives . DAT-1.A: Representing Data with Bits . Basic Information . Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1. A byte is 8 bits. | . | Sequences of bits are used to represent different things. Representing data with sequences of bits is called abstraction. | . | . Practice Questions: . How many bits are in 3 bytes? | There are 24 bits in 3 bytes. . What digital information can be represented by bits? | Data can be represented with bits, which can include strings, integers, booleans, and images. . Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two? | Bits are digital because they are in the form og 0s and 1s. This can only be one of the other. . Examples . Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary. 0 = False | 1 = True | . | . import random def example(runs): # Repeat code for the amount of runs given while runs &gt; 0: # Assigns variable boolean to either True or False based on random binary number 0 or 1. boolean = False if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else True # If the number was 1 (True), it prints &quot;awesome.&quot; if boolean: print(&quot;binary is awesome&quot;) # If the number was 2 (False), it prints &quot;cool.&quot; else: print(&quot;binary is cool&quot;) runs -= 1 # Change the parameter to how many times to run the function. example(10) . binary is cool binary is awesome binary is cool binary is awesome binary is cool binary is awesome binary is awesome binary is awesome binary is awesome binary is cool . DAT-1.B: The Consequences of Using Bits to Represent Data . Basic Information . Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors. | Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory. | Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits | . Practice Questions: . What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits? | The largest number that can be represented by 5 bits is 31. . One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language? | The second language can represent 40 times more bits, which is 2^40 times as many bits as the first language. . 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (hint: different thatn question 1) | The largest number that can be used is 15 because 4 bits are reserved for representing negatives and positives and then the rest are reserved for representing actual numbers. . Examples . import math def exponent(base, power): # Print the operation performed, turning the parameters into strings to properly concatenate with the symbols &quot;^&quot; and &quot;=&quot;. print(str(base) + &quot;^&quot; + str(power) + &quot; = &quot; + str(math.pow(base, power))) # How can function become a problem? (Hint: what happens if you set both base and power equal to high numbers?) exponent(5, 2) . 5^2 = 25.0 . DAT-1.C: Binary Math . Basic Information . Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1. | Decimal is Base 10, meaning each digit can represent values from 0 to 9. | Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions. | . Practice Questions: . What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent? | The values of 0 to 4 are able to be represented by Base 5. . What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent? | Hexadecimal is Base64, which can represent from 0 to f. . When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system? | In the Base30 system, the 23rd number would be n. For Base50 is would be n again. . Examples . Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64. | The numbers in a sequence of binary go from right to left, increasing by powers of two from 0 to the total amount of bits. The whole number represented is the sum of these bits. For example: 111111 | 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 | 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 | 63 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to decimal) . 001010 = 2^3 + 2^1 = 8 + 2 = 10 | 11100010 = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 2 = 226 | 10 = 2 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to binary) . 12 = 2^3 + 2^2 = 1100 | 35 = 2^5 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 100011 | 256 = 100000000 | | .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

Here I got this question wrong because I thought that it would take the time for the longest operation in a parallel computing problem. This however isn’t true because all the processes will be slowed when they are all run at the same time. There are only 2 processes running at once, and when the shortest two processes are run together and added up based on the amount of time taken, the amount of time is 80 seconds rather than the 60 seconds of the longest single running program. . Question 2 . . Here I got this wrong because metadata isn’t used to decrypt data because the metadata would be encrypted along with the original data, causing problems with the unencrypting of information.

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # It took the set of numbers and then printed them in order, as well as taking out the garbage data. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets probably have unique values in order to check for duplicates and fixing data sets. . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Time and Space Complexity . . The answer here is number 3 because the first loop is O(n) and the second loop is O(m). They are independent of each other and are run separately, so the time is O(n+m) and the time is O(1). | . . The answer here is number 4 because the function involving j runs inside the function i, meaning that the time complexity is O(n*n). This is because both functions involve n. | . . The answer here is number 2 because j keeps doubling until it is less than or equal to n. A number can be doubled multiple times until it is less than n, which would be log(n). | . . The answer here is number 2 because this means that X will always be the better algorithm than the Y algorithm.

The answer here is 2 because the more operations performed by an algorithm, the more complex it is, compared to the input size. | . . The answer here is 3. This program is k^(n-1) and when the log is taken, it becomes log(k)n, | . . The answer here is 3 because the first loop is run for n times and the second one is run for n-1 times. This means that the overall complexity is n(n-1). | . . The answer here is 2 because algorithm A is constant while algorithm B is exponential. This means that as the input size increases, the time it takes for a program to run also increases, but for A, the time stays constant. | . CB Quiz . .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . Programmers should care about space and time complexity because the amount of space and the amount of time that a program takes up depends on how efficient the program is. The less space and time the program takes up, the better the program is, but only if it completes all necessary tasks. | .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. The first section of code will probably take a shorter amount of time than the second section of code, however the difference shouldn&#39;t be very large. If the function were to be replaced, the time should shorten or lengthen based on the size of the fibonacci sequence. | . | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 2.025815963745117 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.5262391567230225 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. O(1) is usually the algorithm that takes the least amount of time and stays the most consistent with size. | O(n^2) is good for small sizes in terms of time but gets bad when the input size becomes large. | O(n) is the second best when it comes to small sizes but it stays constant and is also the second worse when the size increases. Time is proportional to the size. | O(log n) is the worst for small sizes but is the best for large sizes in terms of time. | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | This image shows the size versus time each type of sorting algorithm takes up. This is useful when programming and determining which algorithm will be the more efficient to use in certain situations. | | | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space is important when choosing an algorithm because you want to have an algorithm that is appropriate for the size that you are dealing with in order to get the best time results. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? Constant time algorithms are good for any application but exponential ones are only good for specific applications. For small sizes, exponential are better but for larger ones the program becomes very slow and causes problems. With constant time algorithms, although they are bad for small file sizes, the are good for large ones. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? Exponential algorithms usually handle large sizes poorly and slow down as a result, causing there to be a loss in efficiency. The was that algorithms are notated is that as time goes on, the size of the program causes there to be less or more time needed for a program to run. | . | .

Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . A database schema is a blueprint that organizes a database. This specifies where the data is stored and how it will be stored in the database. What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | . | It is used to generate an id for each row in the table. This is used to index the data that is stored in the database so that it is easy to access in the future. It allows the user to simply enter the data they are searching for without needing to ask the user which row or column the data is in. What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | . | The primary key is the unique identifier of each row in a database table, which allows uniqueness in a data table. With this each row can be indexed and parsed when needed in order to extract specific data from a cell. What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . | In SQL tables, there can be numeric values, character values, date and time values, boolean values, binary values, and spatial values. Numeric values are used for integers and decimals in order to store numbers. Character values are used to store alphabetical characters for names and texts. Date and time values are used for storing dates and times. Boolean values are used to show whether something is one or the other. Binary values are used to store images and videos. Spatial values are used to store lines and points, such as svg files. | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? A connection object is used to connect an object to a database of some sort. This is created when there is a connection established between a database and code, which can be used for parsing or updating data in the database. It usually includes location and name and other information such as a username and password in order to search for the data. | . | Same for cursor object? A cursor object is similar to a connection object, except it is used for the retrieval and manipulation of data in the database. This retrieves individual rows and data from the database for later use by the user in the frontend. It is what executes the action requested by the user while the connection object simply allows there to be a connection. | . | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? The conn object has attributes that give information about how the program is operating, such as errors and where the user is currently looking. The cursor object has attributes that are more specific to the data that is being extracting, what it is and where it is located in the database. | . | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? Results is an object that is part of the cursor object. This object gathers the specific material from the database and displays it.

A new user record bob has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part sets a new password to all passwords that are less than two characters. This is similar to what hackers do when they gain access to an account and immediately change the current password to a new password in order to keep the actual user from entering their accounts ever again. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? The try/except tries to add in a new uid and keeps trying until the uid is either not found or until it is updated. If an exception is encountered, an error message is printed because an error in updating was found. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

No uid smith was not found in the table . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? Yes because it can result in the entire database being deleted unintentionally if not used carefully. | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? The f in the print statement is used to format the string so that the variables are inserted into the string correctly.

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

When both Grid I and Grid II are played out in my head, you can picture how on Grid I the robot wil be able to make it to the end without getting stuck to not be able to get the end. In Grid II, the robot would get stuck on the very last turn because it would consider turning right before considering turning left. This means that the robot would turn right instead of left, away from the end goal. This would lead to the robot getting stuck and never being able to reach the end goal. .",

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | orange Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab Different types of images have different compression methods in order to store data in either more or less detail. JPG images have lossy compression, meaning that when they are compressed they lose quality, leading to worse image quality the more they are compressed. PNG has lossless image quality, meaning that when they are compressed, they don&#39;t lose image quality, having better data at a smaller image size. Other types of image formats include SVGs and TIFF files, both of which have a lot better image quality than JPG and PNG. SVG files can be infinitely scaled electronically and the image quality would still be very clear. | . | Size, height and width, number of pixels These determine how large the image is, making the file larger or smaller depending on the amount of data stored in the image. More pixels lead to a larger image, meaning that the image will have more detail. | . | Visual perception, lossy compression Some data that repeats multiple times in a file can be compressed, leading to a smaller file size. The lossy compression is where parts of the data is lost with compression. This is used for pictures and videos for people to view images and videos without having to wait for everything to load. | . | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | . In terminal I use cd to access folders and ls to show the files and folders in the directory. There are other commands like cat and strings, cat used for printing the file contents and strings listing strings. to access files inside the terminal, nano, vim, and gedit can be used to edit the terminal files. | . What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? . In the Windows terminal, dir is used to list the directories and files, tree is used to list the subdirectories of the directories in the file, cd is used to change the directory, and there are also many other different types of commands used to access and select files. | . | What are some of the major differences? . Some major differences between the commands of different operating systems is the syntax, or the way commands are entered into the system. The operating system then takes the command and translates differently based on the different operating systems. | . | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? . Path is important when dealing with images because they are needed to find the files that are requested based on a file path. This is essential to finding the files and later displaying them onto the user interface. There are two different file paths, absolute and relative paths. Absolute paths need to know the full path of a file while a relative path only need the general position of the file, such as in a folder. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? . In Unit 5, we talked about cybersecurity of personal information and how the data can be protected. Meta data is similar to the information stored in security, where there could be sensitive information that may need to stay hidden from the public and is important to protect. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? .

Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Base64 is similar to binary and hexidecimal as it is another way to display numerical data. Binary operates in powers of 2, hexidecimal in 16, and Base64 in powers of 64, meaning that it is useful in storing large amounts of data. | . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. . Translating into binary: D = 068 = 01000100 A = 065 = 01000001 V = 086 = 01010110 DAV = 068 065 086 = 01000100 01000001 01010110 | Splitting into 6 bit chunks: 010001 000100 000101 010110 | Translating result: 010001 = 17 = R 000100 = 4 = E 000101 = 5 = F 010110 = 22 = W | Final: REFW | . | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . Some times when I watch youtube videos, I might experience some buffering problems when the next frames of the video are being rendered to prepare a smoother viewing experience. | . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? . Typically the video will play with a &quot;studder&quot;, with occasional pauses and such to tender the future frames. | . | How do these effects apply to images? . Sometimes, when my browser tries to render a high definition image, it will render each pixel or row of pixels individually one at a time, until the full image has been rendered. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes, there is a series of steps being performed in this code. From a cursory glance, the program includes functions to load up image paths, scaling images, and conversions to base 64. However, the core of the program lies in the image_management() and image_management_add_html_grey() functions. | . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? . For each pixel in the image, the algorithm will take the average of the values in each color channel for red, blue and orange. By taking the average, the algorith now has a singular value to assign to the black and white channel to describe an image in terms of black and white. | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? . The scaling of an image is done by calculating a ratio between the original image and a set base width. After the ratio is calculated, we would calculate a scale tuple to plug into the resize() method provided by the pillow library | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? . This scale image is a type of compression, as we are essentially melding the pixels with their neighbors to reduce the size of the image. In collegeboard terms, this would be known as lossy compression, as it would be nigh dificult to attempt to reconstruct the original color values of the image from an average. | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;orange Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

            "content": "3a. Provide a written response that does all three of the following: . i. Describes the overall purpose of the program: . The overall purpose of the program is to allow students to enter their classes into the input fields, including class period, class number, class name, and start and end times. This information is then formatted into a table and map, allowing the students to have an organized schedule list with classroom locations. . ii. Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video . In the video, the input and display of data is demonstrated. This is shown by typing information and selecting information from the input fields and then displaying it on the table and map. Once the page is reloaded, the data stays there because it is stored in an api. . iii. Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video . In the video, the period number, class name, class number, and start and end times of the class are inputted by the user. When the Add button is pressed, the data is displayed on the generated table and map, as well as stored in the API database. The clear button, which is an input from the user, clears all the data from the API and the populated table. . 3b. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program . i. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list. . . ii. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose . . iii. Identifies the name of the list being used in this response . The list being used here is schedule.db, which is formatted into a table and is used to store and post data onto the frontend of the website. This way the data is stored is in something called a database, which is defined in the schedule python class. Inside, the data points are defined, including class period, class name, class number, and start and end times. . iv. Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your program . The data is stored in the database file as strings. These strings are inputted by the user and posted through networking with JSON into the API, which formats it into the database. These data points represent the qualities of the class that they choose to add to their schedule. Without the storage of the data into the API, the data would have no meaning as it would be deleted upon reload of the webpage. . v. Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list . Without a list, the program would not be able to run at all. The list is critical to storing the data the user inputs and without the list, the data would be lost from the user every time the page is reloaded. The program could be entirely written with the use of localstorage, which would store the data locally on the computer with cookies, however, moving to a different computer or deleting your browsing history would entirely delete the data you have previously entered. . 3c. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure. . i. The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that: . Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary) | Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure | Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration | . . ii. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program. . . . iii. Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program . The function ScheduleListAPI() contains many subsections. This procedure allows the callback of all data, as well as the deletion of all data through the functions get() and delete(). It allows all of the data to be recalled whenever the webpage is reloaded, allowing access to anyone from anywhere, and it also allows the data to be entirely redone if one isn’t happy with it’s contents. . iv. Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it. . When the user enters their data, the data is sent to the API through the addLocal() function. This pulls the parameters containing the information the user inputted from the input fields and sends it to the API in a JSON list known as data. This is done through a POST request from the frontend to the API. | Once the API receives the JSON data, it parses through the it, assigning it to each of the variables used to store the data in the database list. If the API detects a problem with the data being inputted, it sends an error message with the server error at hand. | Once the data storage has been successful, the data can be called back with a fetch from the frontend, through the getList() function. When this is called, the get() function is called, parsing through the entire database by id and sending all of the information to the frontend for organization and use. | If a user chooses to delete the data they have, the remove() function is called, sending a DELETE request to the API, causing all of the data in the list to be deleted, only if there are no errors in the data. | . 3d. Provide a written response that does all three of the following: . i. Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute . The ScheduleListAPI() function is called a first time when the user initially loads the page, requesting all of the stored data in the API be brought out in a readable format through the get() function into HTML formatting. | The function is called a second time when the user decides to delete the data, causing the displayed data to entirely disappear through the delete() function. | . ii. Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the procedure: . Each time the procedure is called, the API tests for errors in the data that may prevent the frontend code from running properly. . The first call checks through all of the data in the API list, making sure that the data is correctly formatted. If it is, the data is sent to the frontend to be displayed. | The second call checks whether there are any server errors involving the formatting of the data and if there are none, all of the data is deleted. | . iii. Identifies the result of each call . The first call results in the pulling of all the stored data out of the API and into the display of it onto the frontend. | The second call results in the deletion of all stored data in the API and the disappearance of it in the frontend. | .",

            "content": "Our Project . Overall, people enjoyed learning about our productivity project. We showed them all of our features, which were the schedule maker, the todo list, the task timer, the notebook, and the calculator. Everyone agreed that these tools could be useful in their daily lives at school or at home. . We used a flask API permanently hosted by AWS which stores data that the users input into our features. This is done through a wifi connection, which when created, the DHCP server assigns the device you connected with an IP address, allowing the device to now connect with the Flask API amd the GitHub Pages site. In order to connect to everything, the computer requests the IP address of the GitHub Pages site and sends the data using TCP in packets. The Github Pages site receives the data and is displayed as HTML through https://. When the user inputs data into the Github pages site, the site sends POST, UPDATE, GET, and DELETE requests to the Flask API. In this way, the Github pages site uses TCP to collect data and send it to the Flask API for storage. When the Github Pages requests data from the Flask API through the DNS server, the Flask API sends the data back to the Github Pages through TCP with packets. . . Here we are presenting to others about our program. . . Here we are presenting to more people about our program. . Other Projects in CSP . ETrack . This program had a exercise tracker, exercise goals, a forum for people to share their goals and ideas, a fitness calendar, and fitness stats based on a per person basis. The entire goal of this program is to track a person’s fitness and help them reach their personal goals, as well as share with others their goals and achievements. All features are connected to an API hosted on AWS, where all of the data that the user inputs is sent and stored for future use when the page is reloaded. . . This is the program created by Liav and his group. . Triple AJ Arcade . This program included a ping pong game, a reaction time game, a snake game, a game called hi-lo, where the user guesses a number, and a leaderboard for all of these games. The goal of this program was to create a place where people could have fun and be competitive with their friends. The program uses lists to store data in the API through networking between the Github Pages and the Flask API database. . . This is the program created by Azeem and his group. . Project Snake . This program had a snake game and a checkers game where people could play the games and could store their scores based on their user ids. The program used lists to store the data in the Flask API using networking between the API and Github Pages. . . This is the program created by Max and his group. . Project NASH . This program is an arcade game, which includes a snake game, wordle, a color game where you look for the slightly different colored square, and a trivia game. All of these games have their scores managed by Flask API, where the data is stored and called whenever it is needed. The data is stored in lists in a .db file. . . This is the program created by Nathan and his group. . Ceramics . In the ceramics exhibition I found an interestingly designed teapot with a mug. It was made to look like a small house and the cup looked like a flower. The colors on the pottery were very well made and the design looked very clean. . .

Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. There are open source and close source licenses: open source allows for anyone to use the program, without needing to pay | close source requires payment to authors based on what user makes from distribution | . | Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal doesn’t allow for something to be copyrighted and is for public domain | . | Open Source MIT License allowed for code to be used and then made into a closed source version for distribution | authors still want credit (comments) | . | Open Source GPL License GNU GPLv3 - people can do anything with project except distribute | . | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. As a group, we decided to use Open Source GPL for our group project. This is because we want others to be able to use our program, as well as learn from the code of our program by playing around with it. We don’t, however, want people stealing our program and distributing it to others for their own personal gain, as we believe everyone should have access to such a program. | In terms of legality and ethics, I believe that we should give credit to those that we use code from. Many other divisions of society use digital rights for their movies and music, which prevents pirating the content of a company. This is how large companies are able to make income from their productions. | In our class, I think it is best to use open sourced licenses because people should be able to learn from the code we produce and share among one another. Companies, however, need to create products with licenses in order to make a profit and support future projects that they might want to enact. | . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. For both my fastpages as well as our group flask and github pages website, we decided to use the open source GPL license, which allows others to modify our code in order to learn, but doesn’t allow them to distribute our work for their own personal gains. This will allow for others to learn to code by playing around with our creations. | . | . 5.6 Reflection . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. PII that I have seen on my project involves information such as period number, classroom number, class name, start times, and end times of classes. This data isn’t very sensitive, however on other projects, I have seen the request for emails, birth dates, passwords, and phone numbers, which are much more sensitive. | . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I that with PII, we should be cautious of what we share and do on the internet. With PII, anything on the internet can be tracked down to us in the real world eventually. There are also people looking for that information online, who want to take it in order to do bad things. PII is good for bank websites and other programs that need your information in order for you to store something very personal. | . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. A good password has many different characters in it, causing people who want to find the password to have a very difficult time actually finding our what it is. This also makes it harder for hardware, such as supercomputers to find your password, as the longer it is, the more time it will take to be cracked. A bad password is a short one with generic phrases and characters, making it really easy for anyone to guess and steal. Another step of authentication is a code that is sent to the user either through phone number or through an authentication app that changes the code every 5 minutes. | . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is where there is only one secret key that encrypts and decrypts information. | Asymmetric encryption is where there is a public and a private key used to encrypt and decrypt information. | . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. In AWS, we used SSL encryption, which uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption in order to keep data safe. | . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. There are many phishing schemes that are created and used. One of them is where the attackers sends a link that looks similar to a login page, tricking the user into thinking it’s the actual login page, where they enter their information and then their account is stolen. Social engineering is used in this to make the site look like the original in order to entirely trick the user. This form is very prominent in Discord, where many create phishing links and send them, advertising them as free nitro or free money or some other form to attract the user. They then take control of the user’s accounts to either buy a lot of discord nitro or to send even more links. | . | .",

            "content": "5.3 Computing Bias . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Facebook usually targets people over 25 years old, while TikTok targets people that are under that age. This is probably not purposeful because the younger generation tends to lean towards fast paced content while the older generation tends to lean towards slower and verbal communication. This is harmful because it tends to become addicting but also it helps divide the information presented to different age groups. This is good business because it allows for ads and other things to be targeted to certain people. | . | Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? They have female voices because they tend to be more soothing to the general audience, allowing them to be more comfortable. This leads to them to associate women as an assistant, which could lead to negative impacts. This has already been corrected by allowing users to choose the gender of their voice. This is good business because it leads to more consumers feeling comfortable and liking the product. | . | Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) Algorithms usually make what is shown to the user appeal to them based on their old search results and histories. It is also trained to look at their age and gender and recommend things based on what others in those groups like. This is true throughout all of the companies that are listed. | . | . Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas… . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Yes, he thought that this was intentional. | . | If yes or no, justify you conclusion. He thinks this is intentional because the camera doesn’t follow his face, while it does follow his white coworker’s face, clearly showing that it works with one skin color btu not another skin color. | . | How do you think this happened? This has probably happened because HP has either not tested this feature with people of dark skin color, but also they could’ve not designed the program correctly in order to work for people of darker skin color. | . | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? This is harmful because it excludes certain groups of people from using the device, leading to a consumer shortage for that device, as well as ethical questions from the public upon the company. | . | Should it be corrected? Yes, this should be corrected in order to include the group of people that were excluded from the testing group initially in the use of the product. | . | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? In order to produce a better outcome, the product should be tested on a larger group of people, ensuring diversity in the users is possible. | . | . Summary . From this section, I have learned that bias is very hard to overcome in anything. This is why testing with multiple different instances in different environments is needed in order to eliminate as much bias as possible. With this, programs will be able to work for anyone without anyone having trouble using them because of how they look or their abilities. There is some bias that is also intentional in order to make the user experience more comfortable for all users, leading to better reviews on the program. With my program, I can not only apply it to students but also people in their daily lives, with their own schedules. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . Wikipedia is an example where a large amount of information is sourced from many different sites, leading to mostly accurate information. | Crypto also uses crowdsourcing by using multiple processors to process information, verifying that it is correct, leading to the output of money. | COVID data allows for areas in society that are contributing and not contributing to the spread of the virus, leading to restrictions being put in place. | . Questions . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A crowdsource idea could be having a website with tips and tricks on the class. This would be a Github repository that everyone in the class would be able to edit, leading to the ability for a lot of information on the class and how it works to be gathered. This would help future students who are considering taking the class or already taking the class. | . | What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Something similar could be created for Del Norte students with all of the different classes in the school, allowing students to help each other with different classes with advice and tricks. My project could be better with crowdsourcing by showing which hallways in the school are more crowded and which ones are easier to get around, allowing for students to find their way around the school faster, rather than getting stuck in “traffic jams”. | . | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. I could capture data one which classes are taken the most based on different grades. This would allow for “pre-made” schedules, students having the ability to pick a certain schedule type based on what others have taken and are taking at the same time. This would make the program more easily usable, as well as quicker to use. | . | .",

My code will have a function that takes all of the user’s inputs, including class name, period number, start times, end times, and classroom numbers. This information would be stored in a list, as well as with another function, display the information for the user to see. Another function would take the information from the user and create a map of their classes, which will then be connected with another function, showing the user the fastest way between their classes. This would be considered data abstraction because the list of the inputs from the user would save space because the program wouldn’t have to assign variables to every room number and then display each variable for the user to see with a path between them. This is also managing complexity because the saved data from the user would be used to calculate distances between each room number with one function, rather than one individual function for each person. | . Consider what will be demonstrated in video, aka video plan . In the video I would show myself inputting the data into the program and displaying an output for the users to see, when the add button is pressed. This would also add a point on the school map, beginning the calculation of the fastest distance between classes on the map. An improper input would be typing in a wrong room number and editing an input would be changing a value in the created schedule. This would show all required parts of the video. | .",

This is probably because I didn’t read the question very well. I should’ve read the question more carefully to see that it was asking for a number greater than or equal to 15 and I should’ve also checked my work mathematically. . Question 13 . . Here I also simply made an error when reading the question. It would obviously not be I because the person would be older than old enough to drive but also old enough to vote because you can vote when the age is equal to 18. For the rest of the answer choices, this wouldn’t be the case as it is never equal to 18 but always equal to or greater than 16. .",

Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? | The good thing about internet blockers at school is that sites that aren’t exactly good are blocked from school users. There are also bad things about having these blockers, such as actually blocking useful information from students that really need it or blocking information that can be sensitive but is required for study in the classroom. Teachers can also regulate what students see in the classroom, which is a good thing, but also during lessons if a teacher were to make something at home and then have it blocked at school, that would be bad. | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. | My concerns about the digital divide come from the inability to have access to more powerful machines that other students do have access to. This may limit me from having the full technological capabilities that I as a student should have. Others who don’t have access to technology at all may have a very big difficult in the future, especially as everything is becoming digital in today’s day and age. This would seriously limit one to what job they can take up in the future. | .",

View/Blog Concepts . A notes/blog would be created to add Notes between students and teacher, part of original concept. Notes could be used for many types of applications.

In this design, most recent messages are on top | Messages are intended to support markdown and inclusion of images | Think about technique to format images in conjunction with Text | . Hacks . Build and correlate a technical design between frontend view and backend model. This blog is focussing on frontend view., and visual concepts on how CRUD operations are presented to user of system. This particular Jupyter Notebook and code within it are used to help establish technical ideas. Start a design for your project... . Each project must have a View (as pictured) and Model (json data is fetched into the View). Describe your project. | Describe your View. Use Markdown, HTML, UML, other visuals, tables are used to characterize a project. This shows the Teacher and Graders understanding of planning Model and View. | Transition from pure design and start inserting code elements, like inputs. Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple ... This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit. Student(s) could assist in rework of my Flask project from last year into a Frontend / Backend solution.

This is an example of importing math into python (imports the function sqrt() to do math) . Hacks . import math def alg(x,y): z = x + y a = math.sqrt(z) result = math.cos(a) print(str(result)) alg(1,2) . -0.16055653857469052 . In this piece of code I import math, which is a library used in calculation of different things. I then define a function, alg() with the parameters x,y. I add x to y and then make that number equal to z. After that I square root z with the math.sqrt() function from the math library. I set this value to a and then I take the cosine of a with another function, math.cos() which gives me a result. The result is then printed as a string. I later define the parameters x,y as 1,2 in an argument. . 3.15.1 - Randomization . randomization - generates a value between two numbers . allows for random values to be produced | . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 6 . The result will change however this shows two numbers being randomly generated in a certain range of numbers and then adding them. . There are different methods that can be used in randomly generating numbers. . Method Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator | . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator | . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator | . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits | . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range | . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range | . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence | . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence | . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order | . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence | . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 | . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters | . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) | . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) | . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) | . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) | . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) | . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) | . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) | . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) | . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) | . Hacks . import random list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;] result = random.choice(list) print(result) . strawberry . This output will change with the program being run. . import random imports the random library, which allows the use of different functions that are predefined in the library to randomly pick a string or integer from a list. This is useful in shortening code down to a couple of lines. . Some other things that can be imported: . import fibo - allows fibonacci sequences to be created with less code | import pickle - allows for conversion between bytes and strings/integers | import json - allows for conversion between JSON | import calendar - allows for calendar integration in python | . 3.15.2 - Random Generators . random(a,b) - creates a random number between the range a,b and this can include a and b . Coin Flipper: . import random flip = random.randint(0,1) if flip == 0: print(&quot;heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;tails&quot;) . heads . The output can be either heads or tails, depending on the random value that is generated, which is 0 or 1. . 50% Chance to get a number: . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 . This makes a chance of getting a number that is less than or equal to 50 is 50%. . Hacks . import random x = random.randint(0,7) if x &gt;= 5: print(&quot;green&quot;) elif 3 &lt;= x &lt; 5: print(&quot;blue&quot;) elif x == 2: print(&quot;purple&quot;) elif x == 1: print(&quot;red&quot;) elif x == 0: print(&quot;orange&quot;) . green . This output will change with each run of the program since it is random. . random.randint(12,20) - All numbers within the range of 12 &lt;= x &lt;= 20 are valid outputs of the function. This is because of the parameters defined in the function, which are (12,20). Every other number is excluded from the selection of a random number in this function. . 3.16 - Simulation . simulation - imitation of a situation or process to get information on the product . Examples: safety, efficiency | more effective and and safer to perform as well as less costly | might not be as accurate as real life experiments | . Four Corners - code vs real life . Real Life . less efficient | took a lot of time to execute and took a lot of people to perform | people have strategies | .

This output can change depending on the random results. . Game of Life - interactive simulation . Goals: . created unpredictable cellular automation | evolves without any patterns, entirely random | . How it Works: . cells are dead/alive (0 or 1) | user configures cells and then runs program that randomly generates cells alive = dead cell is surrounded by at least 3 alive cells | dead = alive cell is surrounded by 1 or 0 other alive cells | survival = alive cell consistently surrounded by 2/3 alive cells stays alive | . | . This program shows the use of iterations, conditionals, and functions being called to create a simulation of some sort. . Hacks . 1) One simulation that could be done is finding which path is the longest out of a set of multiple paths. In this case the program would take the measurement of each of the paths and compare it among all the paths and from there decide which path is the shortest. . Extra Credit Code: . x = input(&quot;What is the length of path 1?&quot;) print(str(x) + &quot; ft&quot;) y = input(&quot;What is the length of path 2?&quot;) print(str(y) + &quot; ft&quot;) z = input(&quot;What is the length of path 3?&quot;) print(str(z) + &quot; ft&quot;) path1 = x path2 = y path3 = z pathList = [path1, path2, path3] fastest = min(pathList) print(&quot;The shortest path is &quot; + str(fastest) + &quot; feet long.&quot;) . 4679460 ft 245858 ft 4670606 ft The shortest path is 245858 feet long. . 2) Quiz . questions_number = 6 answers_correct = 0 questions = [ &quot;True or False: Simulations will always have the same result. n A: True, n B: False&quot;, &quot;True or False: A simulation has results that are more accurate than an experiment n A: True, n B: False&quot;, &quot;True or False: A simulation can model real world events that are not practical for experiments n A: True, n B: False&quot;, &quot;Which one of these is FALSE regarding simulations n A: Reduces Costs, n B: Is safer than real life experiments, n C: More Efficient, n D: More accurate than real life experiments&quot;, &quot;Which of the following scenarios would be the LEAST beneficial to have as a simulation n A: A retail company wants to identify the item which sold the most on their website, n B: A restaurant wants to determine if the use of robots will increase efficiency, n C: An insurance company wants to study the impact of rain on car accidents, n D: A sports car company wants to study design changes to their new bike design &quot;, &quot;Which of the following is better to do as a simulation than as a calculation n A: Keeping score at a basketball game, n B: Keeping track of how many games a person has won, n C: Determining the average grade for a group of tests, n D: Studying the impact of carbon emissions on the environment&quot; ] question_answers = [ &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot; ] print(&quot;Welcome to the Simulations Quiz!&quot;) def ask_question (question, answer): print(&quot; n&quot;, question) user_answer = input(question) print(&quot;You said: &quot;, user_answer) if user_answer == answer: print(&quot;Correct!&quot;) global answers_correct answers_correct = answers_correct + 1 else: print(&quot;You are incorrect&quot;) for num in range(questions_number): ask_question(questions[num], question_answers[num]) print(&quot;You scored: &quot;, answers_correct, &quot;/6&quot;) .

You scored: 6 /6 . 3) Rolling Dice Simulation - In the rolling dice simulation, the user first picks a number of die that they want to roll, needing to be within a range of 1 to 6. From there the program checks what number is inputted and then rolls the number of die that the user has picked. This is done by choosing a random number between 1 and 6 and then repeating this for the number of die chosen in the beginning. The results of the random numbers generated are then outputted to the user in a list. This is a simulation because it isn’t in real life and it is simpler and faster than in real life. The advantages of this is that it is faster and simpler to do in code than in real life. The disadvantages is that it is less accurate than in real life examples. I think that in this situation a simulation is better in simulation because it is entirely random and gives outputs fast. . 4) Changing Dice Simulation: . def parse_input(input_string): if input_string.strip() in {&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;}: return int(input_string) else: print(&quot;Please enter a number from 1 to 6.&quot;) raise SystemExit(1) import random def roll_dice(num_dice): roll_results = [] for _ in range(num_dice): roll = random.randint(1, x) # increased range of random number chosen roll_results.append(roll) return roll_results num_dice_input = input(&quot;How many dice do you want to roll? [1-6] &quot;) x = int(input(&quot;Please enter the number of sides you want the dice to have.&quot;)) # variable for sides the dice should have num_dice = parse_input(num_dice_input) roll_results = roll_dice(num_dice) print(&quot;you rolled:&quot;, roll_results) . you rolled: [118, 180, 50, 291, 315, 105] .

This string is then put into a list which is later cycled through with another loop after a certain number of inputs have been achieved. The loop goes through the created list and outputs the user’s inputs into a formatted list. This is much more efficient because there isn’t one line of code that is repeated in the program, meaning that the programs cycles on it’s own to repeat a certain action. | .

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): for i in range(len(numbers)): min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] return numbers print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): for i in range(len(numbers)): min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] return numbers print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment .

This one uses booleans to express the outputs. . Hacks . It is important to know that functions can look different and still do the same things because there are many different ways to code something but the final products is still the exact same. This shows that some programs can be complex while other are simpler, allowing coders to eventually achieve the most simple way of coding a function. Some functions can look the same while completing entirely different things. This shows that code has similar parts that can be put together to complete entirely different things. This is also important to know because one piece of code that is wrong can look different from another piece that is correct. .

College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | .

Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 6 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 .

Heads . import random flip = random.randint(0,1) if flip == 0: print(&quot;heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;tails&quot;) . heads . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange.

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) . Complete this quiz: . questionNum = 3 correct = 0 questions = [ &quot;What is are correct names for a procedure? n A) Method n B) Function n C) Both&quot;, &quot;What is a procedure? n A) Sequencing n B) Selection n C) Iteration n D) All&quot;, &quot;Use this for following question: n def inchesToFeet(lengthInches): n t lengthFeet = lengthInches / 12 n t return lengthFeet n n What is the procedure name, the parameter, and what the procedure returns? n A) feetToInches, lengthInches, lengthMeters n B) inchesToFeet, lengthInches, lengthFeet n C) inchesToFeet, lengthFeet, lengthInches n D) lengthInches, inchesToFeet, lengthFeet&quot;] answers = [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] def qna(question, answer): print(&quot;Question:&quot;, question) response = input() print(&quot;Answer:&quot;, response) if response.lower() == answer: print(&quot;Correct :) n&quot;) global correct correct += 1 else: print(&quot;Incorrect :( n&quot;) for x in range(questionNum): qna(questions[x], answers[x]) print(&quot;Score:&quot;, correct, &quot;/ 3&quot;) . Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional .

Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . hw = 6 classes = 5 hwdo = True if hwdo == True: if hw &gt; 0: while hw &gt; 0: if hw &gt; 0: hw -= 1 print(&quot;Homework left: &quot;, hw) if hw == 0: hwdo = False if hwdo == False: print(&quot;No homework, go study!!!&quot;) while classes &gt; 0: if classes &gt; 0: classes -= 1 print(&quot;Classes left to study for: &quot;, classes) if classes == 0: print(&quot;Relax!!!&quot;) .

Classes left to study for: 4 Classes left to study for: 3 Classes left to study for: 2 Classes left to study for: 1 Classes left to study for: 0 Relax!!! . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } .

Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

Below is an algorithm building on the previous algorithm: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } else if (30 != 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is false&quot;) } . Conditional statements can be used for many a purpose. The algorithm above was quite simple, but conditionals can be found in more complex algorithms. . Binary Numbers . Let&#39;s do some truth tables! . Speed round . Challenges . Challenges Related to the Lesson That I Solved Myself . Note: I did these in Python . Level I: Vowel Count . Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this challenge (but not y). The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. . Hint: If you use a lot of if-statements and there are more than one outcome, that is to be expected. If not, don&#39;t panic, just keep trying. . Level II: Who Likes It? . You probably know the &quot;like&quot; system from Facebook and other pages. People can &quot;like&quot; blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item. . Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples: . [] --&gt; &quot;no one likes this&quot; . [&quot;Peter&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Peter likes this&quot; . [&quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Alex&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Jacob and Alex like this&quot; . [&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Max, John and Mark like this&quot; . [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Jacob&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;] --&gt; &quot;Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this&quot; . Note: For 4 or more names, the number in &quot;and 2 others&quot; simply increases. . Hint: This requires you to combine knowledge on lists along with the conditionals you learned in this lesson. . Level III: Mutliples of 3 or 5 . If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. . Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). . Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. . Hint: What do you know about for loops? Since your code incorporates a list of numbers from 1 to the max number, can you use for loops along with conditionals? . Level IV: Likes vs. Dislikes . YouTube had a like and a dislike button, which allowed users to express their opinions about particular content. It was set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time. There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface: Pressing a button, which is already active, will undo your press. If you press the like button after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous &quot;Dislike&quot; state. The same is true for the other way round. . Create a function that takes in a list of button inputs and returns the final state. . Examples: . /* like_or_dislike([Dislike]) ➞ Dislike like_or_dislike([Like, Like]) ➞ Nothing like_or_dislike([Dislike, Like]) ➞ Like like_or_dislike([Like, Dislike, Dislike]) ➞ Nothing */ . Notes . If no button is currently active, return Nothing. | If the list is empty, return Nothing. | . Hint: This is like level III, but harder, so don&#39;t give up! . Level V: Find the Odd Number . Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. . There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times. . Examples: . [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd). . [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd). . [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd). . Hint: This is by far the hardest challenge out of all of these, in my opinion, and it took me about 3 or 4 months to solve this one. .

AND: 1 AND 2 = 0 OR: 1 OR 2 = 3 XOR: 1 XOR 2 = 3 . Lesson 3.7 James . Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | they&#39;re nested one inside the other | An else if inside of another else if | Can be used for a varying amount of &quot;else if statements.&quot; The first if statement can represent if two coditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true. | . Take aways .

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . alex . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . item = &quot;Apples&quot; price = &quot;1&quot; print(item + &quot; cost $&quot; + price) . Apples cost $1 . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Variables (3.1.2) - Noor . Learning objective for 3.1.2: . Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;-- as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] . Lets Look at an Example: . x = 10 y = 20 z = 30 x = y z = x # what do you think z will be? print(z) . 20 . Let&#39;s get a little more practical here . Imagine that you are making a calendar and have just finished the html code that is needed: . You now want to be able to switch between the months of the year by using the &quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot; buttons you will need to take the html elements and use them to your advantage but how? | . | . | . &lt;body&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;month&quot;&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;prev&quot;&gt;Prev&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; // to make our lives a little easier, we can store the div next and prev into variables // this way we don&#39;t need to type out as much // Note: You CAN just add the event listener to document.querySelector(.next) or prev and get the same desired outcome nextButton = document.querySelector(.next) prevButton = document.querySelector(.prev) // we can go make the buttons functional by adding an addeventlistner to them &lt;/script&gt; . Recap: . We learned what is a assignment operator | We learned how to use the assignment operator | We learned how to store a value inside a variable using the assignment operator | We experimented with a few examples | . Hacks: . Answer these: . In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? | . Hacks: . Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code. The problem is that it is not converting the decimal to binary. This is because the variables are not defined properly and it is your job to use the information learned today to fix the converter. Don&#39;t change the css . Bonus (optional): . There&#39;s more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it. . Rubric . For .15: . Student has followed directions properly and has the converter working | . For .18: . Student has completed some of the bonus material alongside requirement for 2.7 | . For .20: . Student has completed all of the material, answered thoughtfully, and met requirements for 2.7 | . List and Strings Using Variables- Nathan . Strings . Strings is a series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters. . The following are all examples of strings being used in code, in this case, within print functions. . print(&quot;hello world&quot;) print(&#39;hello&#39;) . hello world hello . Lists . Lists are sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom. . Features of Lists . The elements within the list can be accessed by index. | Can store various elements | The list is in order | . Example of a list . foods = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;] print(foods) print(&quot;Forwards: &quot; + foods[1]) print(&quot;Backwards: &quot; + foods[-2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;chicken&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;candy&#39;] Forwards: bread Backwards: pear . List Index . An index is an element of a string. Indices typically start with 0, but Collegeboard has the index start at 1. . Hacks . Questions . What is a list? | What is an element | What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? | What is an example of a string? | . Hacks . Create a list with indices | Index a part of the list that you created. | Try to index from the end | . Create an index of your favorite foods . Tips: Index starts at 1, Strings are ordered sequences of characters . Extra work: Try to create an index that lists your favorite food and print the element at index 3. More work: Create a list of your favorite foods and create an index to access them. . marks = [&quot;food1&quot;] . Rubric . Creating a list . Shows great knowledge in creating lists | . Indexing . Is able to index both from the start and from the end | . Data Abstraction with Lists - Steven . Data abstraction can be created with lists. . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . bits = input(&quot;Input a sequence of bits to invert: &quot;) splitbits = list(bits) for i in range(len(splitbits)): if splitbits[i] == &#39;0&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;1&#39; elif splitbits[i] == &#39;1&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;0&#39; print(&quot;&quot;.join(splitbits)) . 6 . Hacks . The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn&#39;t connected to the abstraction. | . num1=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num2=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num3=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) add=input(&quot;How much would you like to add? &quot;) # Add code in the space below numlist = [int(num1), int(num2), int(num3)] # The following is the code that adds the inputted addend to the other numbers. It is hidden from the user. for i in range(len(numlist)): numlist[i - 1] += int(add) print(numlist) . [6, 7, 8] . The following provides a rubric for my hacks (scored out of 0.20) . 0.20 - Fully functioning data abstraction with a list | 0.10 - not functioning, but attempt at making a list | 0.00 - not functioning, no evidence of attempt based upon the guidelines | . Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the &quot;long and slow way&quot; to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . score1 = 95 score2 = 24 score3 = 87 score4 = 92 print(score1, score2, score3, score4) . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as &quot;score1 = 95&quot; and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient... | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . scores = [95, 24, 87, 92] print(scores) . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification . It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables . You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don&#39;t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | . Python Quiz . Now everyone should take this short python quiz and screenshot your score. | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 4 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;The purpose of lists and dictionaries are to manage the ____ of a program&quot;) if rsp == &quot;complexity&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Lists are a form of data ______&quot;) if rsp == &quot;abstraction&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Which brackets are used to assign values to a variable to make a list?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;[]&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .

Q19 Adding numbers in 4-bit representation . . On this question, I didn’t know what type of numbers could be expressed in binary. This is because I haven’t learned binary and how to read it. . Q20 Bits needed to represent directions . . On this question I forgot how to calculate the amount of bits that are needed to store information. I need to relearn this. . Q22 Decimal value not equal to given binary values . . Here, I made the same mistake again because I don’t know how to read binary or calculate the value that is usually outputted by binary. . Q24 Put binary and decimal numbers in order . . I made the same mistake again, because I don’t know how to read binary and be able to calculate the values that are outputted by binary. . Q36 Store even numbers in evenList . . Here I made a mistake with how to initialize the value i that will lead to multiple outputs. I didn’t see that i was initialized as 1 rather than it usually being 0, so I thought that adding 2 to i would result in an even number, but it results in an odd number. Answer C is correct because it multiplies i, which is 1 by 2, making it even. After this, i is set to 2 and then the next even number can be taken and so on. .

Errors . errors are a part of coding, they are expected | Types of Errors: Logic Errors | Syntax Errors | Run-time Errors | Overflow Errors | . | Logic Errors - make mistake in algorithm, causing the program to behave differently | Syntax Errors - making a typo on the code, causing the program to not run (colon/semicolon, parenthesis, braces, indentation, quotes, var def) | Run-time Errors - works for a bit and then crashes, caused by a certain line of code in the sequence (called a bug) divide by 0 | improper user input | . | Overflow Errors - result in certain values that are too big to show or to calculate | . How to Correct Errors . most syntax errors are shown where in the lines the error is located sometimes are close by | . | logic errors can be solved with test cases (works sometimes but not always) | hand tracing - write out values of the variables in the loops used for small code sections, not large ones (use debugging program) | . | adding extra output statements - used to find where the error is (allows computer to show where the error is) | visualizations - used to show where the error is with graphs | debuggers - allows the user to pause/play the program as is runs | . Testing Programs . starts with thinking in development on how the program will work use specs to see what the errors are and how it should work | . | when inputs and outputs are determined, the program is tested used to revise and improve program | users later continue to test to make sure everything is working | mistakes are always found, even after release | . | .

Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99, &quot;salad&quot;: 4.99, &quot;toast&quot;: 2.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times while total &lt; 3: item = input(&quot;Please select 3 items from the menu&quot;) print(&quot;Item ordered:&quot;, item.lower()) for k,v in menu.items(): if item.lower() == k: print(&quot;Your total order is $&quot;, menu[item.lower()]) total = (total + 1) break if item.lower() != k: print(&quot;Try choosing your item again.&quot;) continue #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user .

Here, we asked students about some of the sources of stress they experienced. . . Here, we asked students whether they felt unhappy or sad. . . Here we asked, on average, how much sleep did the students get. . . Here we asked whether or not the students were in a positive social circle. . .

Formatting List/Dictionary (With For Loop) . To start formatting the data, print_data() must be used. | d_rec must then be used to state that a dictionary record is going to be printed. | Use square brackets [] to place the terms that are going to be printed. | Use for_loop() to loop the InfoDb dictionary that was defined earlier until there are no more terms to print. | print_data(record) is used to pass the dictionary record to the function. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Email:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Hacks Questions . Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | . Yes, a loop and reversed() can be used to reverse the order of the printed dictionary. . Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | . Lists can be used to create quizzes and listing items, such as shopping lists and data about a certain entity. . Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | . You can add to a dictionary data set by creating and defining a new list. You could ask the user for an input and then store their input as a list, which can later be outputted when called upon. . Python Quiz Using Dictionaries . This is an example of a quiz that uses dictionaries to store the questions and answers. | . import getpass, sys # importing libraries for quiz def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question:&quot; + prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) print(&quot;Answer:&quot; + msg) def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) return msg q_list = [] q_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;import&quot;, }) q_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;if&quot;, }) q_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;expression&quot;, }) q_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What are words surrounded by quotation marks called?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;strings&quot;, }) q_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What tab in Github is used to monitor the status of the changes you push?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;actions&quot;, }) questions = len(q_list) #total number of questions asked correct = 0 #default number of questions correct print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) #prints the greeting of the test print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) #prints the amount of questions that are going to be asked rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) #asks for user input before starting the test if rsp == &quot;yes&quot;: #compares the user&#39;s input to the correct answer, which is &quot;import&quot; print(&quot;Lets Start!&quot;) for question in q_list: print(question[&quot;Question&quot;]) response = input(question[&quot;Question&quot;]) if response == question[&quot;Answer&quot;]: print(response + &quot; is the correct answer!&quot;) correct = correct + 1 else: print(response + &quot; is incorrect.&quot;) quotient = correct / questions #defines quotient ptge = quotient * 100 #defines ptge print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions) + &quot; or &quot; + str(ptge) + &quot;%&quot;) #this prints the score that the user gets . Hello, davidv running /bin/python3 You will be asked 5 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? Lets Start! What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed? import is the correct answer! What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example? if is the correct answer! Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is the correct answer! What are words surrounded by quotation marks called? strings is the correct answer!

            "content": "Lab #1: Measurements and Graphical Analysis . Purpose Statement: Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through a graphical method. In using graphical methods, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Procedure: . Fold disks in half. . | Measure the diameter. . | Divide the diameter in half to find the radius. . | Record data. . | Unfold the disk. . | Weight the disks on the scale and record data. . | Fold a disk until it is one millimeter thick. . | Divide one millimeter by the number of layers the disk now has to get the thickness. . | Record data. . | Questions: . What is the precision of the meterstick I used? . | The precision of the meter stick is up to 0.1 millimeter. . Explain how you know this based on the data I provided. . | We know this because the meter stick that was given to us goes to the millimeter. This means that when measuring something, it is usually measured in one below the exact level of precision. . Mass and Radius Measurements .   Radius (cm) Mass (g) Thickness (cm)   Radius Squared (cm2) . Disk 1 | 2.35 cm | 0.08g | 0.0015625 cm |   | 5.5225 | . Disk 2 | 3.20 cm | 0.14g | 0.0015625 cm |   | 10.24 | . Disk 3 | 4.10 cm | 0.23g | 0.0015625 cm |   | 16.81 | . Disk 4 | 5.25 cm | 0.38g | 0.0015625 cm |   | 27.5625 | . Disk 5 | 6.90 cm | 0.70g | 0.0015625 cm |   | 47.61 | . Graph 1 (Mass vs Radius): y = 0.018867x2 - 0.039x + 0.069478 . Mass vs Radius . . x-axis: radius (r) . y-axis: mass (m) . Graph 2 (Mass vs. Radius Squared, linearized): y = 0.014763x - 0.012136 . Mass vs. Radius Squared . . x-axis: radius squared (r2; also represented with c here) . y-axis: mass (m) . Calculations: . p = m/v → m = pv . v = π * r2 * h . constants . m = p * π * r2 * h → cm = (g/cm3) * π * cm2 * cm → cm = (g/cm3) * π * cm * cm2 → Equation 4: m = r2 . Analysis Questions: . What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . | The independent variable in the linearized graph is the radius squared (r2). This is because the mass of the disk depends on how large the disk is, which is measured with the radius. . What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . | The slope of the linearized graph represents the proportional relationship between the mass of the disks and the radius of the disks, squared. This is because when the original graph, which shows the relationship between mass and radius, is linearized, it is found that mass and the radius squared are proportional. This is derived below. This means that the units of the slope are g/cm2. When this is put into the linear equation, it can be derived that mass is equal to mass, which proves the relationship is valid dimensionally. . Calculations: . Density: p = m/v → m = pv Volume: v = π * r2 * h . constants . m = p * π * r2 * h → cm = (g/cm3) * π * cm2 * cm → cm = (g/cm3) * π * cm * cm2 . Equation 4: m = r2 . y = mx + b → g = g/cm2 * cm2 + g → g = g + g → g = g . Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . | The “b” of the linearized graph has to go through zero because theoretically, a circle with a radius of 0 will ultimately have a mass of 0. Experimentally this isn’t possible however because of data that is not precise. . Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . | Average Radius: (2.35 cm + 3.20 cm + 4.10 cm + 5.25 cm + 6.90 cm) / 5 = 4.36 cm . Average Mass: (0.08 g + 0.14 g + 0.23 g + 0.38 g + 0.70 g) / 5 = 0.306 g . Volume: 0.0015625 cm * (4.36 cm)2 * π = 0.093313 cm3 . Density: 0.306 g / 0.093313 cm3 = 3.28 g/cm3 . Percent Error: ( | 3.28 g/cm3 - 2.7 g/cm³ | / | 2.7 g/cm³ | ) * 100 = 21.48% | . Errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . | Our number is smaller because our measured thickness is too thick. This is because the thickness of our materials that the disks are made of is really difficult to measure. This is because our material is aluminum foil and aluminum foil is very thin and hard to measure with a meter stick. We found that our disk measurements are too thin because if the thickness is increased, the volume that will be calculated is larger and when that volume is used to calculate the density, the larger volume value will decrease the final density value if all other variables stay constant. This is why our experimental value is larger than the theoretical value. . Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . | The slope of the line of best fit would’ve probably been more aligned with the experimental values. This means that the experimental value for density would be closer to the theoretical value because the chance of error while measuring the thickness of the disks would be less. . How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . | The slope for the linearized graph would’ve been steeper because steel has a larger density than aluminum. This means that as the radius of the disks increase, the mass would increase at a faster rate, as the disks would be heavier because of the larger density. . . Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . | . Multiple Choice Questions: . You perform the same experiment, but this time you plot a linear relationship between mass and the circumference of the disks rather than the radius. What is the slope of the linear plot? . | . Consider an experiment in which a student measures the mass and diameter of 10 different-sized spheres, all made of the same material of uniform density ρ. For this student to create a linear graph relating the mass of the sphere to its radius r, the student would need to plot mass m versus which quantity: . | .",
