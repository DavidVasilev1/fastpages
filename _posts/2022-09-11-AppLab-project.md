# Planning

## Some ideas for a quiz:
- Car quiz
- Calculus quiz
- CSP quiz
- US History quiz
- Sports quiz
- Physics quiz

These are just some ideas that I came up with for a topic of a quiz that I could make. I ended up choosing to do a quiz on US History, and elaborated on this idea.

## Outline/Objectives

- Create a quiz with 4 questions that covers the topic of US History and Geography.
- Use buttons, images, and screens to allow the user to interact and complete the quiz.
- Make a quiz without any bugs that could interrupt the user's experience while completing the quiz.
- Allow the user to navigate through the different questions without being specifically constrained to one question at a time.
- Calculate the score at the end of the quiz.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/questions.png "This is what my test looks like. One the top, there is a navigation bar to move through questions.")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/passing.png "This is what getting a passing score looks like.")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/failing.png "This is what a failing score looks like.")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/answers.png "This is an answer key that can be reviewed by the people who fail.")

## What Went Well:

- For the most part, coding the buttons was pretty easy and designing everything was overall easy to accomplish.
- Once all the bugs were sorted out, everything managed to work well.

## Setbacks:

There were many setbacks along the way:

- One problem I encountered was that when switching between the second and first questions with my navigation bar, the answers that were selected by the user were deleted for some reason. As a result, I had to eliminate one of the questions.
- Another problem was the scoring, which wouldn't work until I put it in a separate function from the one that held the answer checking script.
