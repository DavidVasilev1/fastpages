## 5.3 Computing Bias

- Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
   - Facebook usually targets people over 25 years old, while TikTok targets people that are under that age. This is probably not purposeful because the younger generation tends to lean towards fast paced content while the older generation tends to lean towards slower and verbal communication. This is harmful because it tends to become addicting but also it helps divide the information presented to different age groups. This is good business because it allows for ads and other things to be targeted to certain people.
- Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
   - They have female voices because they tend to be more soothing to the general audience, allowing them to be more comfortable. This leads to them to associate women as an assistant, which could lead to negative impacts. This has already been corrected by allowing users to choose the gender of their voice. This is good business because it leads to more consumers feeling comfortable and liking the product.
- Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
   - Algorithms usually make what is shown to the user appeal to them based on their old search results and histories. It is also trained to look at their age and gender and recommend things based on what others in those groups like. This is true throughout all of the companies that are listed.

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas…
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - Yes, he thought that this was intentional.
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - He thinks this is intentional because the camera doesn't follow his face, while it does follow his white coworker's face, clearly showing that it works with one skin color btu not another skin color.
- How do you think this happened?
  - This has probably happened because HP has either not tested this feature with people of dark skin color, but also they could've not designed the program correctly in order to work for people of darker skin color.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - This is harmful because it excludes certain group 
- Should it be corrected?
  - 
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
