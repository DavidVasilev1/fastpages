# Here are my goals for this year:

1. This year I want to learn how to create webpages with CSS, HTML, Javascript, and other coding languages.
2. I want to be successful in this class learning-wise and grade-wise.
3. I want to be prepared for AP Computer Science A, which I will take next year

These are my goals for this class this year.
