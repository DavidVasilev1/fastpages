This is my grade for this test.

## Question 33

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/test5.1.png " ")

Here I got this question wrong because I thought that since both conditions have to be true to equal a certain output, the statement would be AND. This is not true because the first statement can be false and the second true for the same output to still be created. The two arrows at the bottom that converge caused me to believe that this would be AND, but actually they can be split up, it's just that one of those statements being true can lead to that same output.
