This is my grade for this test.

## Question 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/test4.1.png " ")

Here I got this question wrong because I thought that it would take the time for the longest operation in a parallel computing problem. This however isn't true because all the processes will be slowed when they are all run at the same time. There are only 2 processes running at once, and when the shortest two processes are run together and added up based on the amount of time taken, the amount of time is 80 seconds rather than the 60 seconds of the longest single running program.

## Question 2

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/test4.2.png " ")

Here I got this wrong because metadata isn't used to decrypt data because the metadata would be encrypted along with the original data, causing problems with the unencrypting of information. The use of metadata is to route it through the internet, to it's correct destination.
