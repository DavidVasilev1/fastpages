## Reflection

I think that my scoring is similar to Collegeboard's scoring that was shown in the rubrics given. I entirely understand the criteria for what Collegeboard wants to see in this part of the AP exam. I have a couple of ideas on what my project will look like and I think that so far it meets all the criteria. As long as I explain all the parts of the project well, to clearly show what Collegeboard wants to see, I think I have a good chance to get a perfect score. Reviewing more of these projects will, however, continue to assist me in seeing what Collegeboard wants to see from me.
