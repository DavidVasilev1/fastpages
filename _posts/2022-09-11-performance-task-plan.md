## Ideas for the Performance Task:

- Weather summary from NOAA and other databases on a place that the user searches up and wants information about.
  - This could be very useful for daily use, as many people want to know what the weather is and what it will be in the near future.
- Navigation system for schools, calculating the fastest path to get to a classroom.
  - This would be really useful for students that want to get from one class to another, but want to know which route to take in order to get there the fastest.

## Complexity and Abstraction Data

I still have a lot to learn in the world of coding, so for now the tasks I have mentioned above will need a lot of work in terms of how to achieve their desired task. I need to learn how to pull information from online databases and then synthesize that information into a readable format for an average user. I also need to learn how to create algorithms for artificial intelligence to calculate different things.

## Resources

One important resource that I think would be really helpful is Khan Academy, as mentioned by Bria in her post. I believe that this will immensely help me in learning the basics of programing in a visual way and also in a preparatory way. It will help me practice what I have learned and eventually master it. I also believe that Google is a great resource if I am stuck on something because I can get an answer that is explained well and one which I can learn from.
