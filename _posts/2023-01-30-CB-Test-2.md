## Final Results

### Question 10

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q-10.png " ")

Here, I think I misread the question because I picked the exact opposite answers from the correct ones. This is probably because I didn't read the question very well. I should've read the question more carefully to see that it was asking for a number greater than or equal to 15 and I should've also checked my work mathematically.

### Question 13

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q-13.png " ")

Here I also simply made an error when reading the question. It would obviously not be I because the person would be older than old enough to drive but also old enough to vote because you can vote when the age is equal to 18. For the rest of the answer choices, this wouldn't be the case as it is never equal to 18 but always equal to or greater than 16.
