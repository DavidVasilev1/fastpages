## Reflection

I think that my scoring has gotten more similar to what Collegeboard wants to see in terms of criteria based on the rubric. On some parts, I'm still surprised they decided to score the way they did, but they are really strict with some things. Overall I understand what they picked what they did and I can see what I would need to do for them to give a good score. Some of the descriptions aren't as detailed as Collegeboard wanted them, so I need to focus on that when creating my Performance Task. Fulfilling everything else that Collegeboard wants from me should be overall pretty easy.
