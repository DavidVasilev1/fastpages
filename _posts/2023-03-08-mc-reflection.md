### Question 22

THis was a question that I could've easily gotten right, I just didn't read the question very thoroughly. When both Grid I and Grid II are played out in my head, you can picture how on Grid I the robot wil be able to make it to the end without getting stuck to not be able to get the end. In Grid II, the robot would get stuck on the very last turn because it would consider turning right before considering turning left. This means that the robot would turn right instead of left, away from the end goal. This would lead to the robot getting stuck and never being able to reach the end goal.
