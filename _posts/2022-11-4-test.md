## Corrections

I am going to go over all the problems that I missed in this test.

### Q19 Adding numbers in 4-bit representation

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q19.png)

On this question, I didn't know what type of numbers could be expressed in binary. This is because I haven't learned binary and how to read it.

### Q20 Bits needed to represent directions

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q20.png)

On this question I forgot how to calculate the amount of bits that are needed to store information. I need to relearn this.

### Q22 Decimal value not equal to given binary values

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q22.png)

Here, I made the same mistake again because I don't know how to read binary or calculate the value that is usually outputted by binary.

### Q24 Put binary and decimal numbers in order

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q24.png)

I made the same mistake again, because I don't know how to read binary and be able to calculate the values that are outputted by binary.

### Q36 Store even numbers in evenList

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q36.png)

Here I made a mistake with how to initialize the value ```i``` that will lead to multiple outputs. I didn't see that ```i``` was initialized as 1 rather than it usually being 0, so I thought that adding 2 to ```i``` would result in an even number, but it results in an odd number. Answer C is correct because it multiplies ```i```, which is 1 by 2, making it even. After this, ```i``` is set to 2 and then the next even number can be taken and so on.

### Q43 Value of x after REPEAT UNTIL block

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q43.png)

The result is the sum of the values from 0 to 5, which is where the program stops at, not 6, which is the value of x at which the program stops running.
