# Program Design and Development 1.3 Notes

## Development of a Program
- starts with an idea
  - have a specific purpose of what the program should do
  - sometimes development is exploratory (what happens results in what happens next)
- investigate problem and reflect on it
  - results in requirements for the program
  - surveys, testing, and interviews are used to see what is needed
- designing the program
  - brainstorm what the program is going to do to solve a problem
  - create user interface and use
- deciding on requirements
  - list of interactions for user
  - how the program is going to react
  - specifications are going to be used to create prototypes
- testing the program
  - testing on micro and macro level

## Development is Never Solo
- usually many people work on one program or project
  - groups have roles and each are credited for contributions
- comments are used in code to give credit
  - comments and roles allow to see who needs to fix parts of code
- certain sections of code are reused many times
  - developers should credit the authors or the code segments
  - might have a works cited page

## Program Documentation
- documentation is used to describe the code and overall program
  - specs and sections of code are documented
  - also document how the program was developed and who helped
- usually happens throughout the development
  - starts with specs and then goes through process and finally through the overall process
  - gives ideas on how to improve program and also helps remember where you left off
- commenting is used to document things in the code
  - the comments don't affect the code, they are for the programmers
- some languages that use comments
  - Python (`#`)
  - Java (`//` - single line; `/* */` - multiple lines; `/** **/` - multiple line documentation)
  - Javascript, C/C++, Swift - also use something similar to Java
  - XML/HTML (`<!-- -->`)
  - Applescript/Pascal (`* *`)
  - block-based languages use pop-outs for comments
