## 3.1.1 - Data Types and Variables

Variables - abstraction that holds value

Data Types: 

- integer - numbers
- string - text/letters
- boolean - true/false statements

## 3.1.2 - Variables

Storing Values:

- Collegeboard: <--
- Python: =

### Hacks:

1. In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is.
  - It is what is used to assign a certain integer or string into a variable. This is known as an equals sign (=) in Python.
2. In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?
  - An arrow pointing to the left (<--) is used to assign values to variables.
3. A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?
  - The value outputted would be 22, since the latest assignment of x is 22.

## 3.2.1 - List and Strings Using Variables

Strings - numbers, letters, characters that can be printed

```bash
print("Hello World")

# Hello World
```

Lists - allow for multiple strings to be put together into a form that is easily accessible

```bash
list = ["red", "orange", "yelllow"]

print(list)

# ["red", "orange", "yelllow"]
```

List Index - allows to access one element in a list with integers

```bash
list = ["red", "orange", "yelllow"]

print(list[2])

# ["orange"]
```

### Hacks

1. What is a list?
  - A list is a set of strings that are placed under the name of a single variable, leading to an easy way to store data. 
2. What is an element?
  - An element is one of the many strings that makes up a list. These can be called out and printed, leading to easily storing a lot of data.
3. What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?
  - An easy way to reference the elements is to print the variable, followed by an integer, which is how the elements are indexed in the list.
4. What is an example of a string?
  - A string is text that is defined as a variable or an element in a list. This can be directly printed with a print function.

## 3.2.2 - Data Abstraction with Lists

Abstraction - allows for use input to make an output
  - the inputs are put into a list and then outputted with the modified values

## 3.2.3 - Managing Complexity with Lists

Complexity - lists allow for a lot of data to be stored into one line of code, allowing for cleaner code and less work with creating variables

### Hacks

Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code?
  - Lists are better for a program because it is
