## Submission 1

| Category | Criteria | Notes | Student Score | Collegeboard Score |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function |- [x] input- [x] program functionality- [x] output- [x] describes the overall purpose of the program.- [x] describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.- [x] describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.| In this category, all criteria are met, however I think that there could've been more examples shown in order to show that the program works in all instances.  | 1 | 0 |
| Data Abstraction |- [x] includes two program code segments:- [x] one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type).- [x] one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.- [x] identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. - [x] describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. | I think that all of the criteria here are met, however there could've been explanations of the code along with the screenshots provided. There could've also been comments in the code to label everything. | 1 | 1 |
| Managing Complexity |- [ ] includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program.- [ ] explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list.| None of the criteria were met in this section. The list only has classifications for the type of triangle, not data to manage complexity. The explanations are also inaccurate. | 0 | 0 |
|Procedural Abstraction|- [x] includes two program code segments: - [x] one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.- [x] one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.- [x] describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | All requirements here are met and explained well. | 1 | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation |- [x] includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes- [x] sequencing- [x] selection- [x] iteration- [x] explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.| All requirements here are met again. | 1 | 1 |
| Testing |- [x] describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.- [x] describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure.- [x] identifies the result of each call. | All requirements are met. | 1 | 1 |

Reflection:
I think that my scoring is pretty similar to Collegeboard's except for the first section of the rubric. This is my first time grading so I may need some more practice grading to see what is a good program and what isn't based on Collegeboard's wants. Based on what I have seen, I think it is good to have extra things in order to show Collegeboard that you know what you are doing and not just trying to pass the class. On this first one I gave the student a 5/6 while Collegeboard gave a 4/6, the only difference being on the first section of the rubric where Collegeboard considered there to not be a good enough description of one of the sections.

## Submission 2

| Category | Criteria | Notes | Student Score | Collegeboard Score |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function |- [x] input- [x] program functionality- [x] output- [x] describes the overall purpose of the program.- [x] describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.- [x] describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.| Everything here is met very well and there is good, simple description of the program.  | 1 | 1 |
| Data Abstraction |- [x] includes two program code segments:- [x] one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type).- [x] one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.- x ] identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. - [x] describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. | Everything is shown here again, not in code but in blocks, which is still fine. There are good comments in the code as well, showing explanations. | 1 | 1 |
| Managing Complexity |- [x] includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program.- [x] explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list.| Everything here is met. There are multiple examples of the required items and they are all described well. | 1 | 1 |
|Procedural Abstraction|- [x] includes two program code segments: - [x] one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.- [x] one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.- [x] describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | Everything here is described well and all the criteria are met. | 1 | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation |- [x] includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes- [x] sequencing- [x] selection- [x] iteration- [x] explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.| All the criteria are met and everything is described well. | 1 | 1 |
| Testing |- [x] describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.- [x] describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure.- [x] identifies the result of each call. | Everything is described well and organized. | 1 | 1 |

Reflection:
Here, I graded the same as Collegeboard. I think that this program was very well made and described and it met all of the criteria that was needed by Collegeboard. For my program I think that I will need to have good comments in my code, as well as good explanations of all the things that Collegeboard wants to see. I need to have a good program, but also multiple examples of what Collegeboard needs to see so that if one thing doesn't meet criteria, I still have other examples that might meet the standards.
