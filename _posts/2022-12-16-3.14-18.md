## 3.14.1 - Libraries

libraries - a collection of certain predefined functions that help simplify code
 - help save time and effort to help simplify code

```bash
import math

math.sqrt(64)
```

```
8.0
```

This is an example of importing math into python (imports the function ```sqrt()``` to do math)

### Hacks



## 3.15.1 - Randomization

randomization - generates a value between two numbers
 - allows for random values to be produced

```bash
import random

answer1 = random.randint(0,3)
answer2 = random.randint(1,8)
answer3 = answer1 + answer2
print(answer3)
```

```
6
```

The result will change however this shows two numbers being randomly generated in a certain range of numbers and then adding them.

There are different methods that can be used in randomly generating numbers.

| Method | Description |
|-|-|
| seed() | Initialize the random number generator |
| getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator |
| setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator |
| getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits |
| randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range |
| randint() | Returns a random number between the given range |
| choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence |
| choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence |
| shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order |
| sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence |
| random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 |
| uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters |
| betavariate()  | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) |
| expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) |
| gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) |
| gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) |
| lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) |
| normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) |
| vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) |
| paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) |
| weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) |

### Hacks



## 3.15.2 - Random Generators

```random(a,b)``` - creates a random number between the range ```a,b``` and this can include ```a``` and ```b```

Coin Flipper:

```bash
import random
flip = random.randint(0,1)

if flip == 0:
  print("heads")
else:
  print("tails")
```

```
heads
```

The output can be either heads or tails, depending on the random value that is generated, which is ```0``` or ```1```.

50% Chance to get a number:

```bash
random(1,100) <= 50
```

This makes a chance of getting a number that is less than or equal to 50 is 50%.

### Hacks


## 3.16 - Simulation

simulation - imitation of a situation or process to get information on the product
  - Examples: safety, efficiency
  - more effective and and safer to perform as well as less costly
  - might not be as accurate as real life experiments

Four Corners - code vs real life

Real Life
- less efficient
- took a lot of time to execute and took a lot of people to perform
- people have strategies

Simulation
- more efficient
- balanced
- doesn't allow bias of number chooser
- strategies can't be used because it is entirely randomized

```bash
import random

status = "in"
while status != "out":
    chooseCorner = input("What corner do you choose?")

    corner = random.randint(1,4)

    if int(chooseCorner) == corner:
        status = "out"
        print("You chose corner number " + chooseCorner + " and you're OUT")
    else:
        print("You chose corner number " + chooseCorner + " and are still in!")
```

```
You chose corner number 2 and are still in!
You chose corner number 3 and are still in!
You chose corner number 4 and are still in!
You chose corner number 1 and are still in!
You chose corner number 2 and you're OUT
```

Code Explanation:
- random number generator (middle person) = ```random.randint```
- if player is out = if statements
- safe/continue playing = else
- repeat process until there is a winner = while loop

Rolling Dice - simulation
