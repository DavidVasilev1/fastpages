## 3.8.1 - Iteration

Iteration - repeating portion of code (repeats a certain number of times until a certain condition is met)
Iteration Statements - change the flow of control by repeating a set of statements a certain number of times until a condition is met
Repeat Until - iteration that is repeated until a certain condition is met

Iterations are a series of checks to see if certain conditions are met
  - Here is an example of a repeating statement

  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3.8.1.png " ")

  - Here the program is repeated but broken off early to stop the loop:

  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3.8.1-2.png " ")

### Hacks



## 3.8.2 - Iteration Results With For and WHile Loops

Iteration Statements - causes statements to be repeated until the loop meets a criteria

Printing range of numbers:

```bash
for i in range(11):
    print(i)

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

Changing range to start at certain value:

```bash
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

How to print a certain range with certain values:

```bash
for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value):
    print(i)
```

Another way to make a loop:

```bash
i=1
while i<=10:
	print(i)
	i=i+1

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

### Hacks



## 3.8.3 - Loop Types

For Loops - goes through list and for each item it does a check

```bash
pets = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "snake"]
for i in pets:
    if i == "fish":
        break
    print(i)

# cat
# dog
```

While Loops - goes through a list that while a certain condition is met, the loop runs

```bash
number = 0 
while number < 10:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
    number += 1

# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```

Example of sum of numbers between a certain range of numbers:

```bash
minimum = int(input("please enter a minimum number you want your range to be"))
maximum = int(input("please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value"))
sum = 0
for i in range(minimum,maximum+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum += i
print("The sum of all the even numbers between", minimum, "and", maximum, ":", sum)
    
# The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2
```

## 3.10.1 - Lists Functions

[APCSP Testing Reference Sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf)

- len() - returns the number of items in a list

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# find length of list
num_names = len(names)
print("There are" + str(num_names) + "names.")

# There are 5 names.
```

- sort() - changes order of list permanently
- sorted() - returns a copy of the list which leaves the original copy unchanged

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# sort permanently
names.sort()
# sort permanently in reverse alphabetical order
names.sort(reverse=True)
# temp. sort
print(sorted(names))
print(sorted(names, reverse=True))
# reversing the order of a list
names.reverse()

# ['ethan', 'luna', 'nikhil', 'parav', 'taiyo']
# ['taiyo', 'parav', 'nikhil', 'luna', 'ethan']
```

- range() - use to work with number efficiently

```bash
# print numbers 0 to 10
for number in range(11):
    print(number)
# making list of numbers 1 to 10
# using the list() value can generate a large list of numbers
numbers = list(range(1, 10))

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

- min() - find the least value in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
least = min(nums)
print(min(nums))

# 10
```

- max() - find the highest value in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
highest = max(nums)
print(max(nums))

# 70
```

- sum() - sum of all in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
total = sum(nums)
print(sum(nums))

# 270
```

## 3.10.2 - Traversal

Traversing - visiting each element of a list and making a decision based on the value

Traversing Lists:

1. Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed 

2. Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed

3. Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time.

Python Traversals:

- append() - adds element to the end of the list

```bash
names = ['taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# add element to the end of the list
names.append('luna')
# start with empty list
names = []
names.append('taiyo')
names.append('ethan')
names.append('parav')
names. append('nikhil')
```

- insert() - adds element to a specific position (indexing)

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# adding in a specific position
names.insert(0, 'taiyo')
names.insert(3, 'ethan')
```

- remove() - removes item from list (indexing)

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# deleting by value
names.remove('parav')
# by position
del names[-1]
```

- length() - returns the number of elements currently in a specific list
