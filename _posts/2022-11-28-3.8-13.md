## 3.8.1 - Iteration

Iteration - repeating portion of code (repeats a certain number of times until a certain condition is met)
Iteration Statements - change the flow of control by repeating a set of statements a certain number of times until a condition is met
Repeat Until - iteration that is repeated until a certain condition is met

Iterations are a series of checks to see if certain conditions are met
  - Here is an example of a repeating statement

  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3.8.1.png " ")

  - Here the program is repeated but broken off early to stop the loop:

  ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3.8.1-2.png " ")

### Hacks

Iteration - a looping portion of code that repeats until a certain condition is met

Example of Iteration:
1. I have 10 tasks to complete
2. start task "1" and finish it
3. move to task "2" and repeat for "i" tasks
4. if task "5" is reached, stop; that is enough for now

```bash
i = 1
while(i < 10):
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
  if (i == 5):
    print("5 = enough for now")
    break
```

```
1
2
3
4
5 = enough for now
```

Iteration Code:

```bash
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

for i in colors:
  print(i)
```

```
red
orange
yellow
green
blue
purple
```

## 3.8.2 - Iteration Results With For and WHile Loops

Iteration Statements - causes statements to be repeated until the loop meets a criteria

Printing range of numbers:

```bash
for i in range(11):
    print(i)

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

Changing range to start at certain value:

```bash
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

How to print a certain range with certain values:

```bash
for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value):
    print(i)
```

Another way to make a loop:

```bash
i=1
while i<=10:
	print(i)
	i=i+1

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

### Hacks

Iteration Statement - a statement in code that causes a section of code to repeat until a certain condition is met

Countdown:

```bash
for i in range(7, -1, -1):
  print(i + 1)
  i = i + 1
  if (i == 1):
    print("Reached End")
    break
```

```
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Reached End
```

List of Numbers:

```bash
list = [3, 16, 29, 42, 55, 68, 81]
x = 0
y = 0
while x < len(list):
  print(list[y])
  x+=1
  y+=1
```

```
3
16
29
42
55
68
81
```

## 3.8.3 - Loop Types

For Loops - goes through list and for each item it does a check

```bash
pets = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "snake"]
for i in pets:
    if i == "fish":
        break
    print(i)

# cat
# dog
```

While Loops - goes through a list that while a certain condition is met, the loop runs

```bash
number = 0 
while number < 10:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
    number += 1

# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```

Example of sum of numbers between a certain range of numbers:

```bash
minimum = int(input("please enter a minimum number you want your range to be"))
maximum = int(input("please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value"))
sum = 0
for i in range(minimum,maximum+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum += i
print("The sum of all the even numbers between", minimum, "and", maximum, ":", sum)
    
# The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2
```

## 3.10.1 - Lists Functions

[APCSP Testing Reference Sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf)

- len() - returns the number of items in a list

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# find length of list
num_names = len(names)
print("There are" + str(num_names) + "names.")

# There are 5 names.
```

- sort() - changes order of list permanently
- sorted() - returns a copy of the list which leaves the original copy unchanged

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# sort permanently
names.sort()
# sort permanently in reverse alphabetical order
names.sort(reverse=True)
# temp. sort
print(sorted(names))
print(sorted(names, reverse=True))
# reversing the order of a list
names.reverse()

# ['ethan', 'luna', 'nikhil', 'parav', 'taiyo']
# ['taiyo', 'parav', 'nikhil', 'luna', 'ethan']
```

- range() - use to work with number efficiently

```bash
# print numbers 0 to 10
for number in range(11):
    print(number)
# making list of numbers 1 to 10
# using the list() value can generate a large list of numbers
numbers = list(range(1, 10))

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

- min() - find the least value in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
least = min(nums)
print(min(nums))

# 10
```

- max() - find the highest value in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
highest = max(nums)
print(max(nums))

# 70
```

- sum() - sum of all in list

```bash
nums = [10, 30, 40, 60, 70, 60]
total = sum(nums)
print(sum(nums))

# 270
```

### Hacks

Minimum Finder:

```bash
nums = ['38', '45', '67', '83', '78']

min = nums[0]

for i in nums:
  if i < min:
    min = i

print("This is the lowest number: " + str(min))
```

```
This is the lowest number: 38
```

Collegeboard Reference Sheet Notes:

- a MOD b
    - Evaluates to the remainder when a is divided by b.
    - Ex. 17 MOD 5 evaluates to 2
- aList[i]
    - accesses an element in a list based on indexing
- PROCEDURE procName(parameter1...)
    - arg1 is assigned to parameter1
- aList ← bList
    - aList becomes bList, assigning values from one list to another

## 3.10.2 - Traversal

Traversing - visiting each element of a list and making a decision based on the value

Traversing Lists:

1. Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed 

2. Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed

3. Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time.

Python Traversals:

- append() - adds element to the end of the list

```bash
names = ['taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# add element to the end of the list
names.append('luna')
# start with empty list
names = []
names.append('taiyo')
names.append('ethan')
names.append('parav')
names. append('nikhil')
```

- insert() - adds element to a specific position (indexing)

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# adding in a specific position
names.insert(0, 'taiyo')
names.insert(3, 'ethan')
```

- remove() - removes item from list (indexing)

```bash
names = ['luna', 'taiyo', 'ethan', 'parav', 'nikhil']
# deleting by value
names.remove('parav')
# by position
del names[-1]
```

- length() - returns the number of elements currently in a specific list

### Hacks

```bash
import getpass, sys
import random

def ask_question (question, answer):

    print(question)
    ans = input(question)
    print(ans)
   
    if ans == answer:
        print("Correct!")
        return 1

    else:
        print("Wrong")
        return 0

question_list = ["What allows a value to be inserted into a list at index i?" , "What allows an element at index i to be deleted from a list?" , "What returns the number of elements currently in a specific list?" , "What allows a value to be added at the end of a list?"]
answer_list = ["index()", "remove()", "length()" , "append()"]

# Set points to 0 at the start of the quiz
points = 0

# If the length of the quiz is greater than 0, then random questions will be chosen from the "question_list" set
while len(question_list) > 0:
    index = random.randint(0, len(question_list) - 1)
    
# The points system where a point is rewarded for each correct answer    
    points = points + ask_question(question_list[index], answer_list[index])
    
# If a question or answer has already been used, then it shall be deleted    
    del question_list[index]
    del answer_list[index]

# Calculating score using the points system and dividing it by the total number of questions (6)
score = (points / 4)

# Calculating the percentage of correct answers by multiplying the score by 100
percent = (score * 100)

# Printing the percentage, and formatting the percentage in a way where two decimals can be shown (through "{:.2f}")
print("{:.2f}".format(percent) + "%")

# Adding final remarks based upon the users given scores
if points >= 5:
         print("Your total score is: ", points, "out of 4. Amazing job!")

elif points == 4:
         print("Your total score is: ", points, "out of 4. Not too bad, keep on studying! " )

else:
         print("Your total score is: ", points, "out of 4. Its alright, better luck next time!")
```

```

## 3.9.1 - Algorithms

Three main parts: sequence, selection, iteration

Grade Analysis - if/then statements with comparisons:

```bash
print("What Grade Did You Get?")
grade = int(input("Enter Grade:"))
if grade >= 93:
        print("Wow! Good job!")
if 70 <= grade < 93:
        print("Nice!")
elif grade < 70:
        print("Do Better")
```

Small errors in logic can create a problem.


This is the same code as above, but with variables.

```bash
print("What Grade Did You Get?")
grade = int(input("Enter Grade:"))
A = grade >= 90
B = 70 <= grade < 90
C = grade < 70
if A:
        print("Wow! Good job!")
elif B:
        print("Nice!")
elif C:
        print("Do Better")
```

Using comments helps with debugging.

Nested Conditionals without boolean vs with boolean

```bash
# setting variables here
isHoliday = False
isWeekday = True

#if holiday, dont go to school
if isHoliday == True:
    print("don't go to school!")

# otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school
else:
    if isWeekday == True:
        print("go to school!")
    # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don't go to school
    else:
        print("don't go to school")
```

This one uses nested conditional statements.

```bash
isHoliday = False
isWeekday = True

# setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier)
driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday
if driveSchool == False:
    print("don't go to school!")
if driveSchool == True:
    print("go to school!")
# now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional
```

This one uses booleans to express the outputs.

### Hacks



## 3.9.2 - Developing Algorithms

Developing allows for sequencing the algorithms correctly.
  - flowcharts - help with organization

Example with steps and then code (iteration):

1. Start
2. The number of pretzels in the pack is 6
3. Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1
4. How many pretzels are left?
4. Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0
5. Display that pack is empty
6. Finish

```bash
pretzel = 6
while (pretzel > 0):
    pretzel -= 1
    print(pretzel)
    if pretzel == 0:
        print("All done!")
```

Example with predefined values (selection):

The parking rate for a garage is as follows: <br>
Less than one hour: Free <br>
1-2 hours: $5 <br>
2-3 hours: $8 <br>
3-4 hours: $10 <br>
4+ hours: $12

1. Start
2. Input number of hours parked
3. If hours is less than 1, cost is free
4. If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5
5. If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8
6. If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10
7. If hours is more than 4, cost is $12
8. Display cost and goodbye
9. Finish

```bash
print("The parking rate is as follows: \n Less than one hour: Free \n 1-2 hours: $5 \n 2-3 hours: $8 \n 3-4 hours: $10 \n 4+ hours: $12")

time = float(input("How many hours have you parked at this garage?"))
print("How many hours have you parked at this garage?")
print(time, "hours costs:")

if time < 1 :
    print("Free")
elif time >= 1 and time < 2 :
    print("$5")
elif time >= 2 and time < 3 :
    print("$8")
elif time >= 3 and time < 4 :
    print("$10")
else:
    print("$12")

print("Have a good day!")
```

### Hacks



## 3.9.3 - Using Preexisting Algorithms

Can be used to do math in coding, allows shorter code and less work.

Example with even/odd:

```bash
if (n MOD 2 = 0)
{
    display("n is even")
}
else
{
    display("n is odd")
}
```
## 3.11 Binary Search

Repeatedly divides search interval in half.
