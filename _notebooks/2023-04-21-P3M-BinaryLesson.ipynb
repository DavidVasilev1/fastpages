    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for **binary** digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called **abstraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 24 bits in 3 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be represented with bits, which can include strings, integers, booleans, and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits are digital because they are in the form og 0s and 1s. This can only be one of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
    "    - 1 = True\n"

    "### DAT-1.B: The Consequences of Using Bits to Represent Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in **overflow** or other errors.\n",
    "* Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory.\n",
    "* Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits?\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest number that can be represented by 5 bits is 31.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language?\n",
    "\n",
    "The second language can represent 40 times more bits, which is 2^40 times as many bits as the first language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (*hint: different thatn question 1*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest number that can be used is 15 because 4 bits are reserved for representing negatives and positives and then the rest are reserved for representing actual numbers.\n",

    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Decimal is Base 10, meaning each digit can represent values from 0 to 9.\n",
    "* Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Base30 system, the 23rd number would be ```n```. For Base50 is would be ```n``` again.\n",

    "* **Fill in the blanks** (convert to decimal) \n",
    "    1. 001010 = 2^3 + 2^1 = 8 + 2 =  **10**\n",
    "    2. 11100010 = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 2 = **226**\n",
