    "- What is a database schema?\n",
    "  - A database schema is a blueprint that organizes a database. This specifies where the data is stored and how it will be stored in the database.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?\n",
    "  - It is used to generate an id for each row in the table. This is used to index the data that is stored in the database so that it is easy to access in the future. It allows the user to simply enter the data they are searching for without needing to ask the user which row or column the data is in.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "  - The primary key is the unique identifier of each row in a database table, which allows uniqueness in a data table. With this each row can be indexed and parsed when needed in order to extract specific data from a cell.\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "  - In SQL tables, there can be numeric values, character values, date and time values, boolean values, binary values, and spatial values. Numeric values are used for integers and decimals in order to store numbers. Character values are used to store alphabetical characters for names and texts. Date and time values are used for storing dates and times. Boolean values are used to show whether something is one or the other. Binary values are used to store images and videos. Spatial values are used to store lines and points, such as svg files."

    "- What is a connection object?  After you google it, what do you think it does?\n",
    "  - A connection object is used to connect an object to a database of some sort. This is created when there is a connection established between a database and code, which can be used for parsing or updating data in the database. It usually includes location and name and other information such as a username and password in order to search for the data.\n",
    "- Same for cursor object?\n",
    "  - A cursor object is similar to a connection object, except it is used for the retrieval and manipulation of data in the database. This retrieves individual rows and data from the database for later use by the user in the frontend. It is what executes the action requested by the user while the connection object simply allows there to be a connection.\n",
    "- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger.  What attributes are in the object?\n",
    "  - The conn object has attributes that give information about how the program is operating, such as errors and where the user is currently looking. The cursor object has attributes that are more specific to the data that is being extracting, what it is and where it is located in the database.\n",
    "- Is \"results\" an object?  How do you know?\n",
    "  - Results is an object that is part of the cursor object. This object gathers the specific material from the database and displays it. I know this is an object because it gathers data specific to the database and displays it."

    "    - Do you see data abstraction?  Complement this with Debugging example.\n",
    "        - Yes, there is data abstraction in both examples of databases being created. There are classes and objects used to simplify how the data is stored in the database. There are also libraries used, which are imported in order to simplify the code and to allow complex operations to the used without the need for thousands of lines of code. An example of this can be seen when the code is debugged and, in my example, a Car class is made to organize the data entered.\n",
